# Pizza-Pickup

Pizza Pickup is a simple website for those that want to make their own pizzas and have them ready for pickup. 

The user can start customizing their pizza right on the home screen through the select menu for their size and the checkboxes to choose what toppings they want.
After creating their pizza they can submit their order, which takes them to the Order Details page where they can see what they selected and the prices of their order. 
If the user so chooses they can edit their order via a button that opens up a modal for the user to edit. When they are done they can confirm their order via a the Confirm Order button where it takes them to the Final Order page where the estimated time for the pizza to be ready along with the final order billing is displayed.
